This example is derived from the P4 Pascal compiler source code version
downloaded on 2026-01-25 from [Steven Pemberton's Pascal page](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/pascal/).

The original P4 Pascal compiler appeared in 1976. It was created specifically to port Pascal to new systems. 
It generates a simple intermediate code (P-code) which is then interpreted.
The book [The P4 Compiler and Interpreter (Pemberton & Daniels)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/pascal/book/pascalimplementation.html) 
is freely available online. It explains the exact code
of the compiler, and the Micron migration tries to be faithful to the original line numbers.
